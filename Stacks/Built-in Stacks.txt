If we save a file which contains a class as "filename.h" 
it creates its header file of that file containing class
and it can be used same as #include "file.cpp" as 
-------#include "filename.h"------

.h file must not contain the main() function
where .cpp may contain main()

"" denotes that the file must be in the same folder

we can use all properties of .h file in the current file then.

to use inbuit stack of cpp
use #include<stack>
it is also a template stack i.e. to create its obj  we have to use 
----------stack <int> s1;-----

functions for built in stack
1. push() - inserts element in stack
2. pop() - it deletes the top element but doesnt returns it
3. top() -returns top element
4. size() - returns size of stack
5. empty() - checks if stack is empty or not (it is bool type)
